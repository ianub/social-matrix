					<h3>CONTENT PRODUCTION</h3>
					<p>Generating persistent, provocative, engaging, video rich content that is grounded in the customer’s world.  Content that drives a conversation with your audience, not a lecture, gets better engagement.</p>

					<h3>CONTENT CULTURE</h3>
					<p>Creating a brand culture where everyone including customers, engineers, warehouse, logistics, executives, even suppliers, are invested in contributing to the richness of the brand’s social media activity. By allowing your own customers to create content, it enables more authentic customer focused experiences and connects much more effectively with the hearts and minds of your audience.  It also enables a better flow of content – without the big budgets required for professional video productions.</p>


					<h3>CONTENT PRODUCTION</h3>
					<p>Creating a content production plan combining customer designed and professionally made content.  Customers engage with different types of content. We want to reach the most likely prospects to connect and this is best achieved by utilising video. We will also assess blogging, podcasting, articles, recommendations, webinars to get your message across.  Social Matrix has a production process that will minimise cost, help the business insource as much as possible and create an effective content production process to generate engaging content that reaches.</p>


					<h3>CONTENT CALENDAR</h3>
					<p>Creating a consistent engagement plan across all relevant content means and channels, utilising curated, professionally produced and/or customer generated content.  This is not about spending a day a month on producing or curating content and another day on scheduling using automation tools, this is about creating a content plan that allows for proper touchpoints and engagement through all social channels. If a customer engages we must connect.
					Get in touch with us today and we can Content check.
					All content created must check the following 3 boxes:</p>


					<h3>CALL TO ACTION</h3>
					<p>Our client content must consider a pathway to purchase through every piece of content – sometimes explicit sometimes implicit – as we take a customer on a journey.  Remember Social Matrix is generating a business outcome for your brand.</p>


					<h3>FRAMING</h3>
					<p>People connect to people. This means that customers connect to other customers. Social Matrix encourages our partner clients to tell the stories, the real stories of their customers.  Many brands are good at telling the old feature and benefit stories but it does not capture peoples’ hearts – particularly on social media.</p>


					<h3>LINK TO BRAND VALUE</h3>
					<p>Our content produced, whilst vested in the customer’s world,  will clearly link back to the brand story of the client. Remember Social Matrix is here to sell for you.</p>
